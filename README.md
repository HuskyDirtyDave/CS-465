## Architecture
In this full stack project, we employed diverse forms of frontend development, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA). Express HTML and JavaScript provided the foundational layout and logic necessary for our frontend interfaces, whereas the Angular SPA architecture took this to a new level, allowing us to build a highly dynamic and responsive application. While Express HTML rendered static pages, the SPA architecture offered an interactive user experience by instantaneously updating the user interface without needing a full page reload.

On the backend, we opted for MongoDB, a NoSQL database, primarily because of its flexibility and scalability. Unlike relational databases, MongoDB stores data in a JSON-like format that is document-based, making it a more suitable choice for handling varied, complex, and unstructured data.

## Functionality
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and JavaScript, though often used interchangeably, serve distinct roles in web development. JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive web pages, while JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format. JSON's ease of readability and the fact that it is language-independent makes it a perfect conduit for tying together frontend and backend development. It allows us to serialize JavaScript objects, transmit them over a network, and decode them in another programming environment.

In the full stack development process, we continually refactored code to enhance functionality and efficiencies. For example, abstracting repetitive code into reusable functions not only reduced the amount of written code, but also improved its readability, maintainability, and testability. The benefits of reusable UI components were particularly apparent in the Angular frontend. Components such as trip-card and trip-listing could be reused across the application, leading to consistency in the UI and significantly reducing development time.

## Testing
In a full stack application, thorough testing is vital for ensuring the robustness and reliability of the system. The methods for request and retrieval, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, necessitate rigorous testing of API endpoints to confirm they perform as expected. This involves crafting precise requests and analyzing the responses, a process that can be complicated by added security layers. Authentication and authorization mechanisms often require additional steps in testing to ensure only authorized users can access specific resources.

## Reflection
This course has been instrumental in propelling me towards my professional aspirations. The practical, hands-on experience with the MEAN stack has provided a deep understanding of full-stack web development, enabling me to build robust, scalable applications. I've honed my skills in JavaScript, Express, Angular, and MongoDB, learning how to design and implement both the front and backend of web applications, and how to integrate these components into a cohesive whole. Moreover, I've mastered the art of debugging, testing, and refactoring code, skills that are invaluable in any development project. This newfound expertise will undoubtedly enhance my marketability as a full-stack developer.
